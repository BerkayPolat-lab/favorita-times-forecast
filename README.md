# 🏪 Time Series Forecasting for Sales Data

This project implements a Time Series Forecasting algorithm using Python to predict sales trends across various store-item pairs. It leverages techniques to model weekly, monthly, and holiday seasonality, ensuring accurate and robust sales forecasting.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze historical sales data.
- Apply time series forecasting models to predict future sales.
- Incorporate multiple seasonalities (weekly, monthly, holiday effects) to improve forecasting accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of sales records, including:
- **Store IDs**
- **Item IDs**
- **Date**
- **Sales Volume**

The dataset file:
- [The Training Dataset for the Model](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkaypolat/favorita-market-time-series-forecast-train-csv).

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Prophet** (for time series modeling)
- **scikit-learn** (for additional preprocessing if needed)

## Key Features

- **Seasonality Handling:** Weekly, monthly, and holiday seasonality patterns are modeled.
- **Store-Item Level Forecasting:** Forecasting is performed on individual store-item pairs for granularity.
- **Visualization:** Includes plots to visualize actual vs predicted sales trends.
- **Scalability:** Framework set up to handle large-scale datasets.

## Results

The model successfully captures key seasonality patterns and provides sales forecasts with strong alignment to actual trends, assisting in inventory planning and demand management.

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate external factors like promotions, economic indicators, or competitor data.
- Apply hyperparameter tuning for better model accuracy.
- Transition to a production-ready pipeline with automated retraining.
